To ensure my code was technically sound, all requirement conditions have conditional logic and throw exceptions related to the specific requirements. To ensure efficiency I wrote tests for redundancy.  This ensures that we do not create duplicates.  

In reflecting on the development of Project One (Appointment/Contact/Task and respective Service and Test classes).  In regard to the software requirements, every test written was directly correlated to one of these.  For each requirement, there was an assert testing it.

Reflecting on my mindset over the course of develop, I had to think like a tester.  In the classes that I developed, like mentioned many are designed with the tests in mind.

I found that the first set of tests that I wrote for a few classes were indeed influenced by some bias, with the pressure of deadlines I had not done my due diligence to ensure appropriate coverage.  
I had written tests that passed but had not dug into coverage enough to see that there were massive oversights relating to implementation of certain methods.  As a result, I ended up re-writing tests in an effort to ensure a professional level of coverage.  

My old tests still exist as a multi-line comment where applicable.  This allowed me to re-write without fear of losing the old work, while also having a clean slate to move forward with.  

I think ensuring appropriate coverage really helped me see the bias in my own testing.
